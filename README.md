I conducted an in-depth analysis of the impact of COVID-19 in the top 6 GDP countries (United States, China, Japan, Germany, the United Kingdom, and India). I used a comprehensive dataset from Our World in Data, including data on cases, deaths, testing, and responses to the pandemic. The analysis involved various techniques, such as visualizations, correlation analysis, simple linear regression, and time series modeling using ARIMA.

Key Findings:
1. COVID-19 Cases: COVID-19 cases increased in all 6 countries between 2020 and 2022, except for India and China, which experienced a decreasing trend.

2. Population Density: There is no direct relationship between population density and COVID-19-related mortality or cases.

3. Correlation Analysis: A significant positive correlation was found between new cases and new deaths in the United States.

4. Simple Linear Regression: A significant relationship was established between the increase in new cases and new deaths in the United States, with 22.44% of the variability in new fatalities accounted for by daily new positive cases.

5. Time Series Analysis: An ARIMA model accurately predicted the total number of deaths in the United States for the second half of 2022.

This analysis provides insights into the impact of COVID-19 in these countries and emphasizes the importance of following health and safety measures to reduce the virus's spread and protect public health.
